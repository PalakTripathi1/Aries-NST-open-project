Project Title: Neural Style Transfer
Project Description: It allows the implementation of merging two types of images one for CONTENT and other for STYLE to implement a new image by python,tensorflow,etc.
Downloading Images: These commands are used to fetch image files from the internet and store them locally for further use. This could be for various purposes such as image processing, computer vision tasks, or simply to view the images.
After Downloading the images we include the necessary files including matplotlib which allows MATLAB type plotting.
Next here also included various helper functions like to load image and convert image by various tensorflow operations.
After plotting the operations above by matplotlib the is involving the calculations for content and style losses by gramgrid.
In this notebook, we first download the images using various commands, then set up the neural style transfer pipeline using PyTorch. We preprocess the images, load them into the neural network, and perform style transfer by optimizing the target image.
The results of the images by merging Content and Style images is something like this:
